#  Inventory Api
This is an Inventory API that allows authenticated users to create, read update and destroy items and categories.  Users can also create shipments for items and see the remaining quantity of the item after it is shipped.  Users can view low stock items, search for items by product and search for category by title. A list of all shipments is available by item.  There is also a list of all shipments independent of items.
